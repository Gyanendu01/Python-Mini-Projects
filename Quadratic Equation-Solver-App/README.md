# Description:
You are responsible for writing a program that will display the solutions to any number of
quadratic equations. Your program will ask the user how many quadratic equations they would
like to solve, ask for the coefficients of the equation in the standard form of ,xax2 + b + c = 0
solve for x, and then display the solutions. Your program will allow for both real and complex
solutions.
